 # <div align="center"> WellnessLink Business Plan Development   </div>
The purpose was to focus on the development of an entrepreneurial business plan from scratch using principles learned in earlier Business courses. At the beginning of the semester, every student in the 65 person class submitted a 2 minute video, pitching an original business idea. Of those 65, 10 were chosen as the winning ideas with each of the 10 students becoming CEO for their idea. These 10 CEO's would then pitch their idea one more time to the class where the rest of the 55 students would then pick the business plan they wanted to work on for the semester. Once team's were picked, students worked on building the business plan proposal for these ideas with the culmination of a final presentation/pitch to 4 real angel investors.

## <div align="center"> Background </div>
Originally coming up with an app idea for university student healthcare/health insurance services, I was chosen in top 10 and placed as the CEO of my company, WellnessLink. From there I was placed with 4 other team members, each being delegated a specific role based on their specific skillset: CFO, CMO, COO, or CSO.

## <div align="center"> Objectives </div>
The goals of designing a database for the telecom company are:

To store and manage customer information, plan information, and transaction information efficiently.
To track plan activations, plan renewals, plan changes, and customer cancellations.
To provide a system that is scalable and flexible to accommodate changes in the business.
To track call traffic details made by the customers, including call ID, call date, call duration, call type (local, national, international), and call cost.
