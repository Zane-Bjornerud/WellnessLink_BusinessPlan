 # <div align="center"> WellnessLink Business Plan Development   </div>
The purpose was to focus on the development of an entrepreneurial business plan from scratch using principles learned in earlier Business courses. At the semester's onset, each member of the 65-student cohort submitted a two-minute video presentation, introducing an innovative business concept. Out of these submissions, ten were selected for their exceptional potential, with the originators of these ideas assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer for their respective ventures. These ten CEOs subsequently presented their concepts to the class, following which the remaining 55 students aligned themselves with the business plan they were most interested in developing over the course of the semester. Teams were then formed, and students dedicated their efforts to refining the business plan proposals, culminating in a final pitch to a panel of four actual angel investors.

## <div align="center"> Background </div>
My proposal for an application focused on health care and insurance services for university students was recognized among the top ten. Consequently, I was appointed as the CEO of WellnessLink. I led a team of four, each member appointed to a key executive role —Chief Financial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Operating Officer, or Chief Strategy Officer— based on their distinct skill sets.
